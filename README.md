## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

This project follows the **SDLC** approach to ensure a systematic, efficient, and high-quality development process.

### 1. Planning
**Objective**: Define the scope, purpose, and goals of the Research Collaboration Portal.
- **Scope**: Develop a platform for connecting researchers and managing research projects.
- **Goals**:
  - Facilitate collaboration.
  - Improve visibility of research opportunities.
  - Enhance team management.
- **Tools**: Use agile methodology for incremental development.
- **Stakeholders**: Students, faculty, and researchers.

### 2. Analysis
**Key Tasks**:
- Conduct surveys and interviews with target users.
- Develop use case scenarios and user stories.
  - Example User Story: *"As a student, I want to find projects based on my skills so that I can contribute effectively."*
- **Requirements**:
  - Functional: User authentication, project postings, task tracking.
  - Non-functional: Scalability, security, and high availability.

### 3. Design
**System Design**:
- **Frontend**: Interactive user interfaces using React.js.
- **Backend**: RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible data handling.
- **Architecture**: MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

**UI/UX Design**:
- Wireframes and prototypes designed using Figma.
- Ensure accessibility and intuitive navigation.

### 4. Implementation
**Core Technologies**:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js framework).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB (NoSQL).
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 or JWT for secure login.

**Development Process**:
- Agile methodology with 2-week sprints.
- Version control via Git.

**Initial Sprint Features**:
1. User Authentication System.
2. User Profile Creation.
3. Basic Project Listings.

### 5. Testing
**Testing Methodologies**:
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual modules (e.g., user authentication, profile creation).
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Collect feedback from a small group of target users.

**Tools**:
- Jest (Unit Testing).
- Postman (API Testing).

**Bug Tracking**:
- Bugs and issues are tracked on the GitHub Issues page.

### 6. Deployment
- **Development Environment**: Localhost and staging server.
- **Production Deployment**: Hosted on AWS or Heroku with continuous integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.
- **Domain**: A custom domain for the platform, e.g., `researchcollab.edu`.

### 7. Maintenance
- Regular updates for bug fixes and feature enhancements.
- Monitor server performance and user feedback.
- Add new features based on user needs, e.g., grant management tools or AI-driven suggestions.
